# Details #

  * FortranProject plugin enables the compilation of Fortran files directly from IDE. It cares about Fortran file dependencies. Alternatively, users can use own makefile for building of the project.

  * Plugin parses Fortran files and displays Symbols browser with defined program units (functions, subroutines, modules etc.).

  * Enables to jump to the code line with subroutine/function definition directly from editor (right click on the name and select  "Jump to: 'name'") or from the symbols browser (double click on the name) or using menu 'Fortran->Jump->Jump to declaration'.
