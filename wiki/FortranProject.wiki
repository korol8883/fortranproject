= Details =

 * FortranProject plugin enables the compilation of Fortran files directly from IDE. It cares about Fortran file dependencies. Alternatively, users can use own makefile for building of the project.

 * Plugin parses Fortran files and displays Symbols browser with defined program units (functions, subroutines, modules etc.).

 * Enables to jump to the code line with subroutine/function definition directly from editor (right click on the name and select  "Jump to: 'name'") or from the symbols browser (double click on the name) or using menu 'Fortran->Jump->Jump to declaration'.

 * Ads completion of names when you type or when you press Ctrl+Space. The support for subroutine/function names, the names of variables, the components of derived types and the type-bound procedures is implemented.

 * Ads call-tips with subroutine/function argument list.

 * Ads possibility to generate a Makefile (Fortran->Genarate Makefile).
